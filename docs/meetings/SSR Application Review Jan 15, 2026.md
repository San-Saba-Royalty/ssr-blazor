# SSR Application Review

January 15, 2026, 10:00 am

## Notes

### **Application Refactoring and Feature Parity**
- The team confirmed that the **application has been rewritten from scratch** to replicate the old version’s functionality while removing legacy dependencies, with **completion expected by the end of the weekend** (24:00).
- **Travis James** explained the new app mirrors the old one on a one-to-one basis but requires reimplementation of features lost due to deprecated libraries, such as **view persistence and draggable columns** (10:13).
    - The original app’s default view and user-specific views will be restored with saved states across sessions.
    - Drag-and-drop column ordering, a feature in the old app, will be replicated but may be replaced with a simpler ranked list UI for expediency.
    - These UI improvements target better user experience and reduce confusion caused by the old app’s windowed, native-look style.
    - This refactoring eliminates about **$1,200 to $3,000 in annual licensing fees** for third-party libraries, reducing ongoing costs (21:02).
- The team agreed that while some UI elements differ slightly in look and feel, the **new app is faster and functionally sufficient** for end users, with planned refinements to enhance usability (36:26).
    - For example, highlighting and button focus behavior will be adjusted to more clearly indicate active screens.
- Key missing features like **multiple buyers management** will be added as new tabs in the acquisition screen to support complex deal structures (01:03:27).
- The refactor includes moving from physical folder locations to **cloud-based Azure Blob storage**, simplifying document storage and retrieval by associating files with acquisition or letter agreement IDs (53:10).
    - The team resolved to use the **acquisition ID as the primary key** for stored documents, with caveats for letter agreements that may or may not convert to acquisitions.
    - Document version control will be supported with a limited number of historical versions, addressing previous issues of accidental overwrites (01:00:43).
### **Data Views, Filters, and Persistence**
- The persistence and configuration of data views and filters were clarified to improve user workflow and data visibility.
- The system will allow users to **save and switch between named views**, with the last selected view persisting across login sessions for a personalized experience (31:00).
    - Views include selectable fields, filters, and sorting, all of which will be saved and applied by default upon login.
    - Unnamed temporary views will remain session-based and not persist beyond a session.
- The current lack of wiring between view selectors and displayed data was identified as a missing action hookup, which Travis plans to fix for seamless interaction (30:07).
- The team discussed limiting the number of displayed columns to avoid performance issues, recommending users create custom views with only necessary fields for exports or detailed data work (42:17).
- Column ordering and management will prioritize a simple ranked list interface over complex drag-and-drop to avoid users accidentally hiding important data (39:24).
- Filters and views are applied contextually to specific screens, ensuring users see relevant data subsets without confusion (24:09).
### **Acquisition and Letter Agreement Workflow**
- The core business process of managing acquisitions and letter agreements was detailed to ensure the application supports critical workflows effectively.
- The acquisition screen will serve as the main entry point for most users, except landmen who often start in the letter agreement screen (21:44).
- The UI will include a **persistent header panel** displaying key deal information and contacts, helping users understand their current context while navigating tabs like counties, operators, and buyers (01:02:07).
- Multiple buyers can be added and managed as separate tabs under acquisitions to handle deals sold to more than one party (01:03:27).
- Letter agreements and acquisitions are linked but distinct entities; letter agreements generate an ID first, and acquisitions inherit related letter agreement documents if converted (56:53).
    - Letter agreements may have multiple versions, and the system will support **version control with 2-3 historical versions** retained for audit and recovery (01:00:52).
- Invoice and notification generation tied to acquisitions will be implemented next, with clear distinction between documents generated by the system and those scanned and uploaded (04:20).
    - The invoice is directly associated with an acquisition ID, ensuring all financial documents link to the correct deal (59:51).
### **Document Storage and Search**
- Document management will migrate fully to cloud infrastructure with improved search and retrieval capabilities.
- Documents will be stored in **Azure Blob storage**, mapped logically by acquisition or letter agreement IDs, replacing the previous physical folder system (53:10).
    - The folder location field from the old system is obsolete and removed.
- The application will support **uploading scanned documents** and **generating system documents** like tax letters and invoices, each with distinct processes as per business needs (04:20).
- A full-text search feature will allow users to input freeform text and find matching documents across acquisitions, replicating and improving on previous DocuShare and Solaire search capabilities (14:43).
- Document templates will be migrated from legacy file locations to the database-backed storage system, enabling easier generation and management (13:50).
- The UI will be adjusted to remove obsolete features like outdated cover sheets and unsupported document formats such as raw or Word exports (14:08).
### **User Management and Security Roles**
- User administration will be streamlined with plans to improve role-based access controls.
- The current system allows creating and editing users but lacks role and permission frameworks; Travis will implement a basic role system for future expansion (20:36).
- The team discussed preserving user records even after account deactivation to maintain data ownership integrity and avoid orphaned records (19:30).
- Proposed architecture includes using a proxy or intermediary record to represent users who created or modified data, ensuring audit trails remain intact despite user status changes (19:46).
- User profile editing will be simplified by moving it to a dedicated profile icon accessible on login, improving navigation and usability (18:42).
### **Reporting and Output Formats**
- Reporting capabilities will focus on simplicity and direct usability for end users.
- The reporting module currently supports Excel and PDF output, which the team agreed are sufficient for business needs (12:00).
- Word and raw report output options will be removed due to limited use and complexity (12:13).
- Future reports will include clickable links where possible, allowing users to jump from report entries directly to related records in the system for faster navigation (13:04).
- The reporting engine will be updated to replace legacy libraries with modern open-source tools, ensuring maintainability and performance (11:14).
