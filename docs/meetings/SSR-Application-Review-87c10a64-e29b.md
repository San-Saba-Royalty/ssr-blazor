# SSR Application Review

**Meeting Date:** 15th Jan, 2026 - 10:00 AM

---

**Travis James** *[02:08]*: Hey, how's it going there? Okay, so where do you find these? To call it. The paper towels from. To tear it up in there. You found some more? Yeah, go look. Oh, see, I got a meeting coming from right now, but. Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[02:24]*: Oh, big old roll of paper towel. 
**Travis James** *[02:26]*: And I closed the. I closed the door to the pantry. 
**Hal Coon** *[02:29]*: Where I keep all the paper towels. I don't know where you get the prompts. 
**Travis James** *[02:33]*: Oh, look at this. Yeah. I, I, I am baffled. I, I gotta look upstairs or somewhere. I gotta look everywhere that he has access to and figure out what he's doing because he goes and he tears stuff up and he. Yeah, because I, I keep them all. 
**Hal Coon** *[02:50]*: In there in the pantry and I. 
**Travis James** *[02:52]*: The doors are closed. Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[02:53]*: And I don't leave them out anywhere. 
**Travis James** *[02:56]*: What about the laundry room? I see the doors a lot of times open on that. We need to make sure that's closed too, because that's where I normally kept the child before. Oh, okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[03:09]*: Got it. 
**Travis James** *[03:10]*: I don't know what he's doing. He's trying to get attention. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[03:25]*: Hey, Travis. 
**Travis James** *[03:28]*: Hey. How's it going, man? 
**Randy Jesberg** *[03:29]*: All right. Long time no talk. 
**Travis James** *[03:31]*: Yeah, Yeah. I have. My, My dog has. So I have. Somebody's helping me out around the house, you know, and a friend of mine and people help me reorganize things and stuff. And my dog keeps finding paper towels and dragging them out. And we don't know where he's finding them because we hid them. Right. And I don't know where he's getting them, though. It's somewhere in a house that's got paper towels. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[04:02]*: Like a roll of paper towels. And he's. 
**Travis James** *[04:05]*: Yeah. And he. It keeps. And he tears the thing up and brings them to his little play area. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[04:13]*: Man. 
**Travis James** *[04:14]*: I don't know where he's found because we hit everything. I don't know what was going on. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[04:19]*: He's out getting. He's getting. You put him up high where he can't get into him or. 
**Travis James** *[04:23]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[04:23]*: Huh. 
**Travis James** *[04:24]*: Yeah. He's not getting it from there. He thought it must be somewhere else in the house where he's finding them. I don't know. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[04:31]*: That's funny. 
**Travis James** *[04:32]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[04:33]*: Well, that, well, you know what happens when you have a big mansion? You know, you got all these rooms and then can't keep up with it. All. 
**Travis James** *[04:43]*: Three, 500 square feet, man. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[04:45]*: Well, not bad, man. I lived in a 2400 square foot house for 25 years with my two kids. 
**Travis James** *[04:54]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[04:54]*: Before we bought this place. But the. Yeah. So I guess he'll be joining the. He probably is having some kind of trouble. And I got to figure out my fireflies too. It's supposed to be joining these things and it doesn't, and I don't know why it should. It should be automatically joining. I got it. 
**Travis James** *[05:26]*: Am I sending it to the calendar that's hooked up to it? 
**Randy Jesberg** *[05:29]*: Yeah, it should be everything that's on my. Maybe I need to check that calendar. Hey, I want to tell you, I got to go out to GoDaddy today. I think I'm going to shut off Microsoft 365 for SkyTalk. 
**Travis James** *[05:42]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[05:45]*: I, I might. I, I, I went out and looked at it yesterday maybe. Well, I'll go look at it now, but I couldn't find where I need to show. It's going to renew on the 25th. And I don't think we need those email addresses anymore. It's like 100 bucks a year for each email. 
**Hal Coon** *[05:58]*: Yeah, yeah. 
**Travis James** *[06:05]*: So if you want, let me just show you what I while we're waiting here. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[06:10]*: Yeah, bring it up and let's take a look. 
**Travis James** *[06:17]*: Wait for the windows. Come on. Yeah. Okay, you go. So here's the, when you first hit, it hits here to give you hit login to continue. And here you go log in and it gives you this page where you can go and handle things. Right. So if we go to Display acquisitions, which is normally where you go, you know, you get here and of course you can see letter agreements here and set up the, you know, you can, you basically have to, you know, set up the, you know what field you want to show. One of the questions I have is what the persistence of this should be, you know, meaning persistence, meaning, you know, whether as soon as someone updates this, should this persist past the session. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[07:16]*: Hold one second. Okay, I think I just took care of the, Is that. Okay, well, never mind. Let me come back over to where you are and I'll just do this later. So, okay, sorry, can you walk back through that? I was over on another screen. 
**Travis James** *[07:54]*: Yeah, yeah. So when you first get in here, it is a default set of fields that the thing is set up for. And then you click on Comm Visibility to change it. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[08:04]*: Right, right. 
**Travis James** *[08:05]*: And you apply it and then you get to here. Right. Where, where basically just shows you more field. Right. And, and that's where if you go to. 
**Hal Coon** *[08:21]*: Views. 
**Travis James** *[08:24]*: So in general, these views, you see where they have these things where you would apply this set of fields that you want to see for the views. And so I have to do one thing I want to do is just make sure I understand when there's those things are persisted and in how, you know, like when I change the views on this one, if you go back, you see, I go back to letter agreements, it's showing back the default fields again and I got to go select them right now. I need to know if, like, if I do this, whether this is saved or not. Right. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[09:09]*: That should be saved so that every time the person logs in, that's what they see. 
**Travis James** *[09:16]*: Well, that would be, that's why I got asked them for because, you know, the mechanism they have for that would be, is like they have a. This would be a view which you. All those fields would be a view and you would save it and they have another place that you go and create them inside. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[09:30]*: I see, Yeah, I think I remember that. And then, and so you create a view and then you do you set a view that you want to have as your default view every time you sign in. 
**Travis James** *[09:38]*: Right? 
**Randy Jesberg** *[09:39]*: Yeah. 
**Travis James** *[09:40]*: It says these are the fields. But of course there's multiple windows here, not just one. So I, I have to, I just got. Deeply understand the. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[09:50]*: Yeah, I think, now that you mentioned that, I think what he showed us in their app before was like when HAL logs in, he sees hal's default view that is assigned to be there when he comes in. Right, Right. And he can go in and change that default view or he can create another view that he might go and use. I think that's what they said. 
**Travis James** *[10:13]*: Yes. Now that feature is tied to a framework that we no longer use. And so what I've ended up having to do is every time I run into one of those features, I got to implement it. So, so I got to implement something that does kind of like what that does. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[10:26]*: So are we jettisoning features then out of this as well? 
**Travis James** *[10:32]*: We're not. We're going to do them all. I just need to go. I'm gonna have 100 coverage of what that the whole thing used to do. There's just a few questions, you know, on is that error still there? There's a few other, you know, instances that I've got a. I've got to handle. So. And that's where that's, you know, they're very minor, but it's just. I need to make sure I understand. Okay. When does the view have to be named in order to be persisted? And also when. And, and do you have unnamed view sex that should be implicit instead of some either in session state or whatever. So I Was going to ask him those types of things. Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[11:19]*: Okay. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[11:19]*: Hey, can you go, since we're in here, can you go to the input screen for where they go and input deals? 
**Travis James** *[11:30]*: Yeah. For which. Which type of field acquisitions? 
**Randy Jesberg** *[11:35]*: Yeah, right. 
**Travis James** *[11:39]*: This is a new acquisition and this is one of the things I'm going to be discussing with him because, you know. Go ahead. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[11:48]*: Okay. I hadn't seen this screen before. 
**Travis James** *[11:52]*: This is their new acquisition. When you create a new acquisition, this is the one that they use it. Use from. And they have these. Right. So this is where I need to understand here. Right. Folder location, file room stuff. You know what, how I should interpret that in the new. In the new files. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[12:11]*: Where's the input screen that Rachel uses? Where, where they were putting in like the information about the buyer and the. 
**Travis James** *[12:24]*: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[12:28]*: Do you, do you have their. Do you have their other. Do you have their application? Like their current application? 
**Travis James** *[12:36]*: Their current application is accessible through the vpn. So I'd have to turn on a VPN and then I gotta remember how to do. In fact, I'm probably going to have to do that just because, you know, like keep in mind that this code is exactly the same as the other code. But that doesn't mean that. That there's some other things I need to work out. Right. Because. And so that's where, you know, I do need to talk to him about it and everything. But. But you know, you have to your ad seller and you know, unfortunately, because I don't. Didn't know the application really well. I just put it everything word for word. If there's something, I guess we've got to go through it. There's something I kind of missed or something. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[13:19]*: Then I'm just trying to like this isn't the screen I was expecting to see. Go back to file. What. What happens if you go to last acquisition? 
**Travis James** *[13:57]*: Oh, if you go to last acquisition, that would take you basically to the last. We don't have a last acquisition. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[14:05]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[14:06]*: You know, because, because I haven't selected one yet. And that's one of the things I got asking about the rules of like, let's say I select one here, okay. And I say I want to edit it. Well, hold on a second. Let me see here. Give me one second. Because it might be something here. That's. Give me a second here. Okay, here it is right here. Give me a second. I might have to. Every time I run into maybe a little of a bit of an error I have to go highlight the thing and do this. It'll just take a. Take a. About a minute for the thing to figure out what field was named wrong or whatever and then it'll fix it. Their application. That is pretty big. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[16:31]*: So it sounds like it's complicated to bring up their existing application and look at their existing application. 
**Travis James** *[16:38]*: It is. It is pretty complicated to. To go in and look at the existing one. But I mean, I can't do it. It's just like I have to go back to my notes again and see, you know, and. And I don't have an id. That's right. That's the. That's what happened last time. I got to it and didn't have enough. I couldn't log in. That was the. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[16:59]*: Okay, so we've never. We've never logged into their application from your box? 
**Travis James** *[17:04]*: Not from my box. We always went through, you know, theirs or they gave me that one time went through there and they kind of gave me an ID to use or whatever. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[17:15]*: Well, what happened to that id? 
**Travis James** *[17:18]*: Oh, I actually. I don't know if I still have it. Let me look at my notes here, see if I still have that one. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[17:53]*: Try calling him. Hey, Hal, how are you? Yeah, it's okay. Oh, oh, no problem. Do we need a reschedule? No. Okay. Okay. Okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[18:30]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[18:30]*: Teams, there's a. There's a calendar invite out there. Okay. Yeah, I know. Well. 
**Hal Coon** *[18:46]*: What? 
**Randy Jesberg** *[18:48]*: Well, you got a better excuse than I usually do. I'm usually just sitting there and start getting into something else and I'm on the email or something and then I look down and I'm 20 minutes late for the call. Just been sitting there waiting for it the whole time. Need a. You got it? Yeah. Okay. Okay. See ya. 
**Travis James** *[19:22]*: Let's see. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[19:22]*: There he is. 
**Travis James** *[19:23]*: Hey. 
**Hal Coon** *[19:24]*: Hey. 
**Travis James** *[19:25]*: How are you? 
**Hal Coon** *[19:27]*: Let me see. Microphone. Is my mic muted? 
**Travis James** *[19:33]*: No, I can hear you. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[19:34]*: Okay. Can you hear us? Okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[19:36]*: Oh, oh, I see what it said. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[19:37]*: Yeah, Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[19:38]*: I have a thing over the top of my screen saying microphone is muted, but it's the Fireflies AI. So it's a screen size thing. Okay, There we go. 
**Travis James** *[19:50]*: Yeah. Okay. There we go. Yeah. All right, so what you're looking at is your refactored version of the application. 
**Hal Coon** *[20:10]*: Okay. And is this a browser? I'm looking at it in. 
**Travis James** *[20:14]*: Yes. 
**Hal Coon** *[20:14]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[20:15]*: Yeah. And it was essentially. Well, not essentially. It was rewritten from scratch, so I had to. Because the version that you had was so old. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[20:27]*: Yeah, yeah. 
**Travis James** *[20:28]*: And everything. And so I did rewrite the thing now and I have It. I made it as precise as possible, you know, one to one mapping. Okay. But there's some things here that work different because some of the frameworks that you depended on in that old version, they give you certain features. I have to rewrite those features. Right. 
**Hal Coon** *[20:51]*: They go away. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[20:52]*: Yeah, some of those. And I don't know if we've had this conversation, but there were some features in there that you were paying annual fee for. 
**Travis James** *[21:02]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[21:02]*: That, that we've now replaced with things that Travis wrote himself. 
**Hal Coon** *[21:07]*: Okay. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[21:08]*: That, that. Yeah. So it's not huge money, but it's, you know, a thousand here, a thousand there kind of thing that old libraries. 
**Travis James** *[21:17]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[21:19]*: Yeah. 
**Travis James** *[21:19]*: I won with like 2000 a year, 3000 a year. One was like 1200 a year, you know, not huge. But, you know, I basically just rewrote them so, you know, so you don't have to be paying those. And, and so let's. If we go here to, you know, the beginning here, which is like, if. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[21:41]*: You go to. 
**Travis James** *[21:44]*: Here. So first, here's your acquisition screen. Would you say that's the first place you go? 
**Hal Coon** *[21:52]*: It depends. If you're a land guys can sometimes start in the letter agreement screen because they're kind of working the letter agreements until it becomes an acquisition. But yeah, most people, everybody else, if you're not a land guy, you're starting in the acquisition screen because you're working some part of a deal. 
**Travis James** *[22:09]*: Okay. All right, so we'll go ahead and start with the acquisition screen. So this is the default set of fields that you kind of see. And so here's a summary view, financial view. 
**Hal Coon** *[22:35]*: Can I, can you get it where I can see the bottom of the screen? Because I can't tell what's like, is that just an endless set of rows or is that. Does it have like a bottom of a column and a summary rows per page? 
**Travis James** *[22:47]*: There we go. 
**Hal Coon** *[22:49]*: Yeah. 
**Travis James** *[22:49]*: Okay, and this shows all, except to show all the fields. So here's got all the fields that you can see. So anything. 
**Hal Coon** *[23:01]*: But wait, where's like county and unit and things like that? Is that in there? 
**Randy Jesberg** *[23:05]*: Yeah, this is not good. 
**Travis James** *[23:08]*: Okay, so when you say county and unit, when you ask if you get drill into one of them, is that correct? 
**Hal Coon** *[23:15]*: Well, I mean, let me think about this for a second. Am I seeing can. 
**Travis James** *[23:24]*: This is the list? 
**Hal Coon** *[23:26]*: Yeah. I haven't seen anything that would tell me like if I want to go and find an Exxon. Well, how Would I do it from this screen? 
**Travis James** *[23:34]*: Okay. How do you do it from the old one? 
**Hal Coon** *[23:36]*: It. You can see it. You can see it's a unit and an operator. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[23:41]*: I think. I think that the. The issue here is I don't know how the fields that are being displayed on this screen have been selected. 
**Hal Coon** *[23:51]*: Okay. But you can select others as long. 
**Travis James** *[23:53]*: As you can select. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[23:53]*: Yeah, yeah, go to where the filters are. Travis, where he can select which fields are going to be in this view. And let's select the fields that are going to be in this view. 
**Travis James** *[24:01]*: Okay. So, okay, if you go to. To the tools Filters. Okay. Tools filter. 
**Hal Coon** *[24:09]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[24:10]*: Okay. And you have these filters that are all named. So this is a good question. 
**Hal Coon** *[24:14]*: Yeah, the old. I remember all these. Yeah, that's okay. 
**Travis James** *[24:17]*: So, like, do you know if one that you want to take a look at. 
**Hal Coon** *[24:22]*: Is there one that says something about Ann? 
**Travis James** *[24:24]*: Ann. 
**Hal Coon** *[24:27]*: She had a good one. 
**Travis James** *[24:31]*: No, doesn't make the. 
**Hal Coon** *[24:33]*: She didn't make the cut. Okay. 
**Travis James** *[24:38]*: Yeah. And when you say these data filters, do these apply to all screens out there? Because some of the things that you have that in the way you navigate. I'm not sure where they apply. Like the data filters with one, because you. It's a separate screen. You can pick something like this or whatever, and then you can say apply filter. But when you play a. Okay, Apply filter. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[25:07]*: Let's do this. Let's do this. Just to try to get to a point where we're all both on the same page. 
**Travis James** *[25:13]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[25:14]*: How can you bring up the application. Can you log in and bring up the application on your side? 
**Hal Coon** *[25:21]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[25:22]*: Existing application. 
**Travis James** *[25:25]*: I'm gonna stop staring and I'm gonna let you drive in your. Your version of the application. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[25:30]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[25:31]*: How you would do things. And I'll see if I can. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[25:39]*: Oh, where is it? 
**Hal Coon** *[25:42]*: For some reason, it never likes to do it on this machine. Let me in there. Where am I? Okay. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[26:35]*: How do I do this from here? Share. 
**Hal Coon** *[26:39]*: Let's see if I share that one. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[26:41]*: That doesn't have the. 
**Hal Coon** *[26:43]*: I've never done this where I'm not the. The originator of the call. How do I share A screen. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[26:52]*: Should be up near the top on the right. There should be a share button. 
**Travis James** *[26:58]*: Yeah, on the top right. 
**Hal Coon** *[27:00]*: I'm talking about the actual screen itself. I found that. But it was trying to share images of you guys. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[27:07]*: If you select on the left on the right side, there should be just a big. There should be a window on the left. And then if you just select the whole desktop. Can you see that? 
**Hal Coon** *[27:17]*: I can do Screen. But then that puts that picture of me in there. Is that the one I should do? 
**Randy Jesberg** *[27:21]*: That's okay. That's okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[27:22]*: Okay, so I'm sharing that one. Okay, so now I guess. 
**Travis James** *[27:27]*: Yeah, you can open window that you want. 
**Hal Coon** *[27:29]*: Yeah. Okay, so do you all see this one? 
**Travis James** *[27:32]*: Yes. 
**Hal Coon** *[27:33]*: Okay, so this is. If you just start the application, you come in. And so currently there's no filter. And I'm looking at the view called all fields. And that was kind of the thing you were flipping through those different views. 
**Travis James** *[27:46]*: Right. 
**Hal Coon** *[27:46]*: And so when I'm looking at all fields, I see literally all fields. You know, last name, seller name, the landman, the buyer name. And when I was asking about the county and unit, it was this. 
**Travis James** *[27:56]*: Right. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[27:57]*: Okay, so let's do this. Just looking at those first few fields. Right. 
**Travis James** *[28:01]*: That. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[28:01]*: Just that we've got that. So what do we have here? We have acquisition id. Then what is it? Seller last name. 
**Hal Coon** *[28:12]*: Yeah, yeah. And you could probably just go with seller name. You know, you probably don't need them both. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[28:17]*: Seller name, due date, and total bonus. Then Landman. Right, so let's go. Let's flip over now to your screen, Travis, and see how we get there. 
**Travis James** *[28:26]*: But. 
**Hal Coon** *[28:27]*: But there's some other critical ones. These are critical right here. Yeah, county operator unit. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[28:32]*: Well, let's see if we can. If we can flip back over to Travis's now and try to replicate what you've got there in a view here. 
**Travis James** *[28:39]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[28:39]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[28:42]*: I'm about to show mine. Okay, so. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[28:56]*: Oh, now the. The seller name was the first field that was next to acquisition ID on the. 
**Travis James** *[29:05]*: Yeah, yeah. And in this case, it's not. And so the first one. And so. So what I need to do is figure out then, you know, why my default set of fields. Either that. Either there should be. That means that there's probably a default set of fields, things that I'm like, missing or something where it's not. Because in most cases, if you. On the other screens, there are ways for me to specifically, you know, specifically set, like this attribute thing. It has a fixed set of fields here, but on the other screens, this. There's a button for me to just choose fields. Like. Well, maybe it's this one. 
**Hal Coon** *[30:00]*: Oh, there was an. There was Anne's view. 
**Travis James** *[30:03]*: Okay. Okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[30:04]*: So that's how you get to it. See, that. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[30:06]*: That. 
**Travis James** *[30:07]*: Okay, you know what that means that I have to. I have to fix an action so that y' all have an idea of actions that are inside of the old app where they'll fire an action when you select something that's supposed to affect another screen. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[30:22]*: Right. 
**Travis James** *[30:22]*: So that means that I am not. I'm missing a wiring of an action. So that means that this, like if you go to Angie's Tax view. Right. What that means is that I should be able to apply the view, and then over here, it should reflect that view. 
**Hal Coon** *[30:40]*: Yeah, that's what I would anticipate. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[30:41]*: Yeah. 
**Travis James** *[30:42]*: Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[30:42]*: But it's not. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[30:43]*: It's not picking that up right now. It's doing something else. It's just going with some default that's out there. Okay. 
**Travis James** *[30:48]*: Yeah. So. All right, give me one second, because this might be easy to. This might be. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[30:53]*: But I think. I think that the question. One of the questions, Hal, that. That we had about this is the persistence of this. Right. That if. If, if. If you log in and you've. You've previously selected Ann's view, right. Should that view be there the next time you log in? Is it. 
**Travis James** *[31:18]*: Is it. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[31:18]*: Is that. Is that what determines, you know, that it's not just like, for this session that you have that and. 
**Hal Coon** *[31:26]*: And set up their own views and it would retain that and sorts and filters, all that? 
**Randy Jesberg** *[31:31]*: Right. And so, and so if. If I log in and I select An's view as my view, and. And I, you know, I maybe I change it a little bit, save it under Anne's view again, and then I log out, the next time I log in, I should get Ann's view. Yeah. Right. 
**Hal Coon** *[31:52]*: Yes. And also, if you change Dan's view, the next person that uses AnsView should get your changes. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[31:59]*: Right. 
**Travis James** *[32:00]*: Okay. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[32:00]*: Right. So the persistence is at the login level or. Or while I'm logged in, if I select another one, it switches to that one, and then that becomes my default for next time. 
**Hal Coon** *[32:12]*: Yes. Until you change it stays that. Yeah. 
**Travis James** *[32:16]*: Okay. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[32:16]*: Does that answer the question that you were trying to get answered, Travis, or is there another question about persistence? 
**Travis James** *[32:22]*: Because it's real hard to tell because that feature was wrapped up deep in some other library. And so now that I understand how it works, I'll be able to quickly make that work. 
**Hal Coon** *[32:37]*: I have a question about this interface. Am I looking at Mineral Acquisitions right now, or am I looking at letter agreements? 
**Travis James** *[32:44]*: You're looking at Mineral Acquisitions. 
**Hal Coon** *[32:45]*: Okay, so the highlighted. But the one comment I would make is the all records, all fields letter agreements. Those are all live buttons, right? 
**Travis James** *[32:57]*: Yes, they are. 
**Hal Coon** *[32:57]*: Okay. Okay, well, let me ask you this. See that teal frame around a highlighted word? That means that's a button. 
**Travis James** *[33:06]*: Yeah. Like right here. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[33:08]*: Yeah. 
**Travis James** *[33:08]*: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And you can turn these filters on and off and stuff. 
**Hal Coon** *[33:12]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[33:13]*: So, Hal, let me ask you this. You had to ask that question, right? If we flip back over to your screen in your app, there must be some way in your application you would know that. That you're not seeing here. 
**Hal Coon** *[33:25]*: Yeah, well, it's. That. It's. Okay, let me get back to mine. See how to. Okay. How do I share this? 
**Travis James** *[33:32]*: I'm gonna stop sharing. 
**Hal Coon** *[33:33]*: I mean, it's. You're using the same logic. It's the exact same logic. It's just. The difference is on this one, it has more buttony look. Just. And it's just an older artifact of how Windows used to work. 
**Travis James** *[33:45]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[33:47]*: Yes. Right. 
**Hal Coon** *[33:49]*: See how. Okay. See that letter agreement word? I know I'm not in it because this is highlighted black, darker. 
**Travis James** *[33:56]*: Yes. 
**Hal Coon** *[33:57]*: And this, when I float over it, see how it slightly changes behavior? 
**Travis James** *[34:02]*: Yes. 
**Hal Coon** *[34:03]*: So that was the old metaphor for that's a button. And if you click it, you'll get whatever that says. 
**Travis James** *[34:08]*: So. Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[34:09]*: I don't remember seeing. I don't remember seeing those things. Let's go back to your screen. Sorry for the jumping around, but that's all right. Let's go back to your screen, Travis. 
**Hal Coon** *[34:21]*: Yeah, those are just flat, but they come out with different colors and different font, so it's just a slightly different. 
**Travis James** *[34:30]*: So on this one, you see where it says mineral acquisitions? It's. It's. It's light gray. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[34:34]*: Yeah. 
**Travis James** *[34:35]*: But it's the label. And you do lever agreements. It does exactly the same thing. It takes you to letter agreements. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[34:40]*: Yeah, yeah. 
**Travis James** *[34:42]*: Take you back. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[34:43]*: Yeah, yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[34:44]*: But. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[34:44]*: But. Yeah, but that's. That's different than what? 
**Travis James** *[34:52]*: Like. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[34:53]*: Like right now, the letter agreement has a box around it, and the letters are green, right? 
**Travis James** *[34:59]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[34:59]*: Yeah. Is that the equivalent of what were just looking at on your side, Hal, where it's. It's. 
**Hal Coon** *[35:06]*: It's equivalent enough if you were a user of this thing, because I'll show you the. Am I back in it yet? 
**Travis James** *[35:13]*: Yeah, here's confusing. 
**Hal Coon** *[35:15]*: Wait, am I sharing? 
**Travis James** *[35:17]*: Yeah, you are. Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[35:18]*: Okay. See, the only difference. Come on. The only difference is that the mineral acquisitions is bolder, saying that I'm in that. 
**Travis James** *[35:29]*: Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[35:29]*: And that this is a lighter. But see how it's. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[35:33]*: That. 
**Hal Coon** *[35:33]*: It's that shading part that tells you it's a functionality that'll do. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[35:37]*: So. 
**Hal Coon** *[35:38]*: And also the other thing I noticed is yours. If I click this, I believe all it does is just reverse the two. And mine's much lower than yours. See, it flips Them around where yours actually moved it over here, which is good because then it's really telling you're in the mineral acquisitions. You're not in the. Or you're in the. Whichever one. It's trying to tell you. Yeah, but yeah, I can see the difference. And it's close enough to this behavior that I think they'll get it. It might make sense to, you know, emphasize that if possible, but I know some of that stuff. You can't necessarily do it. 
**Travis James** *[36:07]*: I can get that done. 
**Hal Coon** *[36:08]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[36:09]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[36:10]*: Six stuff. Okay, so it's there. It. It's there. It's just, it's slightly emphasized a little differently. It's not as obvious, I guess, what we're saying. It's a little. Okay. 
**Travis James** *[36:22]*: Yeah. So. 
**Hal Coon** *[36:26]*: Let'S see. 
**Travis James** *[36:30]*: I think you can tell the speed difference, you know, as far as like bringing the data. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[36:34]*: We can't. We can't see your screen right now, Travis. 
**Hal Coon** *[36:37]*: Yeah, yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[36:38]*: Okay. So, Travis, you were going to check something real quick to see if you could pick up that view, the assigned view somehow. 
**Travis James** *[36:47]*: Yeah, well, you know what? I'm gonna have to wait a second on that one because there's like three different views I gotta coordinate in order to make that thing work, you know, and I can let it go in. In and figure it out, but it may not be as quick as some of the other things I do. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[37:03]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[37:04]*: Yeah, me, not the act quick, just. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[37:05]*: For my sanity here, what happens if you click on the letter agreement button up there at the top? Which. The frame. Yeah, that guy. 
**Travis James** *[37:13]*: Yeah, it goes to the letter. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[37:14]*: Oh, I see. It pushes it over there to the right. 
**Travis James** *[37:16]*: Which by the way, then allows you to. This one's more easier. You know, you get seller, name, whatever. You can, you know, you can go and choose the fields that are. Belong to that object type. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[37:27]*: Well, the thing I wanted to double check. So while we're doing that. Right. So now this one looks a little bit more like. If you say apply. This one looks a little bit more like what you were asking about, right, Hal, where you were at. But my question is how in. How do you set. Like let's say I wanted to see the banking days next to the seller name. You know, how do you determine what determines the order with which these show up as columns? Or does it just come out the way it comes out always? 
**Travis James** *[38:03]*: Well, I think it's. I think I can answer in your. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[38:06]*: In your existing application now, like, oh. 
**Hal Coon** *[38:10]*: You just put them where you want them it somehow. Unless you drag them. I'm not sure. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[38:15]*: What? 
**Travis James** *[38:15]*: Oh, well, this should be Dragon. Okay. I can. I can get that done. The order of these things. Like, I should be able to grab this thing in an. You know, click it and move it to over here like this. Right. Okay. All right. That's a. That is. I have to replicate that feature. There were a lot of things that expensive library did for you. 
**Hal Coon** *[38:44]*: Right, right. 
**Travis James** *[38:45]*: And I've had to rewrite those things so it could be, you know, it can be done. Not a problem. Just this, like, I gotta. I gotta know, like. Like styles and things. Like, for instance, normally when you drag me something like that, then I've gotta do a different thing when you have her. 
**Hal Coon** *[39:06]*: Well, you know, here's another idea. You know, that's. Go back to that screen where you were picking things. Yeah. Is there any way you could just put a rank, you know, like, pick that and tell me the rank. I want it first, I want it. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[39:21]*: Second, I want it third. 
**Travis James** *[39:21]*: Yeah, yeah. That isn't something that's possible to do. 
**Hal Coon** *[39:24]*: It's just easiest. Do the one that's the most expedient. Because here's the problem with any time I've allowed dragging to happen. 
**Travis James** *[39:32]*: Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[39:32]*: Sometimes objects get lost because people drag them to the edge of the screen and then they shrink them down. I mean, I've had people come to me with spreadsheets I gave them that worked, and they said all the stuff I did disappeared. And they had collapsed it to a line this big, and it'd be like six columns that got drugged together into a line. 
**Travis James** *[39:49]*: Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[39:50]*: If you can figure out a way to make it, where you can just determine what it is and then see it. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[39:55]*: Well, one way, one interface. I've seen for that before. It's kind of like in Windows, where once you've selected things that you want to have, where you end up with two boxes, you have one on the left that says, this is the one I want. And then instead of having checkboxes for them, you put it over in the other box, and wherever you put it, then you can move them up and down, and then that's what you get. That's kind of like the way the Windows Outlook interface works. 
**Travis James** *[40:25]*: Yeah, yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[40:25]*: Right? 
**Hal Coon** *[40:26]*: Yeah, yeah. We use that one all the time in our. The stuff Chris does, that edit he does in that Excel spreadsheet of that SQL statement. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[40:35]*: Yeah. Would. Would something like that, Travis, be like, I like what you said. Do what's most expedient. But I don't know if. I don't know if what I just said Creates a mountain or easier path. 
**Travis James** *[40:47]*: That's. To me, that's better because. Okay. And now. Now this is just. To me. Okay. Okay. So one of the difficulties of this thing here is, you know, of this is that they tried to make the old application tries to make the web look like a. Like it's a native Windows app. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[41:07]*: Right. And even though it's really a web app. 
**Travis James** *[41:12]*: It was really a web app. Yeah. And there's certain things that aren't really that cool about trying to do that. 
**Hal Coon** *[41:20]*: Like. 
**Travis James** *[41:22]*: Yeah. Yeah. And this is one of them. Right? This is like one of them. So. So I'm, you know, everything's being recorded here, so you'll get exactly what you asked for. You know, it was going to be hard to tell without, you know, asking you, so. And everything, so. Oh, hold on. 
**Hal Coon** *[41:47]*: The only reason that I can think of to ever need to get the entire list dumped would be, like, for an export or some kind of backup or something like that. But I don't have a problem with limiting the number of objects that can be put into a frame so that you limit the amount of memory and resource being. You know, because people don't really think about resources when they're picking things. So if you just sort of set a limit of, like, would there be a. Because how many fields are there in that list? 100 and something. 
**Travis James** *[42:17]*: Or there's a lot. 
**Hal Coon** *[42:18]*: Yeah. And. And I. And there's never a reason to have 100 there except for, like, you or me or somebody that's just trying to protect the data. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[42:25]*: Yeah. I remember, like, Renee. I know that on this screen. I think it was this screen Renee. Or Renee would go in and she did some kind of download to Excel of everything, but then got rid of most of it in the Excel file. Right, Right. 
**Travis James** *[42:43]*: Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[42:44]*: What she doesn't realize she could do is go create her own. She could create her own view with just those three fields that she wants. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[42:50]*: Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[42:51]*: And then she could run that Excel. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[42:52]*: File and she'd have it. 
**Hal Coon** *[42:53]*: But that's the thing that. That's what we're working with is a group of people that are very talented at their skill set, but they're not computer people. We want to give them as many tools as we can that just hide the fact they're not computer people. 
**Travis James** *[43:09]*: That works. Yeah, that's going to come up. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[43:11]*: Hal, if we could do this and where. The reason I'm asking you to do this. We. We haven't. We have a little trouble getting into the VPN on Travis's side. Right. Now, but since we're here, can you. Can we switch back over to your screen? I want to go to the acquisition input screen. Okay. Where did it go? 
**Hal Coon** *[43:38]*: It's not. 
**Travis James** *[43:38]*: Let me get to. 
**Hal Coon** *[43:39]*: Oh, there we go. How does it know to pull that up? Are you doing that or is it doing it? I never have control of it. It just sort of flickers for a minute, then all of a sudden that happens. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[43:49]*: Well, I think it's the default. I think that one's the default when you say share. 
**Travis James** *[43:54]*: Oh, okay. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[43:54]*: It. 
**Travis James** *[43:54]*: It. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[43:55]*: It's going to. Let's see. Okay, Go. Can you navigate to the screen where you would input a new acquisition? 
**Hal Coon** *[44:10]*: Where. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[44:10]*: Where Rachel would go. 
**Hal Coon** *[44:19]*: Okay, so for new one, just do, like, file new acquisition. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[44:24]*: Okay. And let's see what that screen looks like. Okay. That's what that screen looks like. 
**Hal Coon** *[44:31]*: But this. But the reason this is not necessarily how it has to look is because of the complexity of what this implies here. Having an invoice and having a buyer when you're selling it to multiple people. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[44:43]*: Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[44:44]*: Somehow this has to, you know, so that's the. That's where it gets complicated. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[44:47]*: Yeah. 
**Travis James** *[44:48]*: We. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[44:48]*: We had done some work on a new artifact that would move a lot of this stuff, like take some of this stuff off and. And rename some things and do some other things. But. 
**Hal Coon** *[44:58]*: Yeah. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[44:58]*: Travis. Travis can just. So you have it handy, can you take a screenshot of this screen? 
**Travis James** *[45:05]*: Yep, I just did. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[45:06]*: Okay. And now let's go. Yeah, there you go. That's probably even better, that one, because that shows the whole thing. 
**Travis James** *[45:19]*: Okay. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[45:21]*: And. And the. 
**Travis James** *[45:24]*: And then. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[45:25]*: And if I remember correctly, the tabs that are here where it's got notes, documents, and history. Right. Those are all still needed, right? 
**Hal Coon** *[45:39]*: Yeah. Well, there needs to be a way to associate a record with those object types. You know, it needs to be pretty simple to get to the things written about that acquisition and. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[45:49]*: Right. 
**Hal Coon** *[45:49]*: For this one. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[45:50]*: Okay. And then. But you've got it. 
**Hal Coon** *[45:53]*: And the art history isn't as important. That never became a thing. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[45:58]*: So that's not really used. So that. That isn't necessarily there as long as there's a way to get to it or somewhere. 
**Hal Coon** *[46:03]*: Yeah. And that was really the reason that's there. That was for Peter as he was doing his development. He just never shut it off. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[46:09]*: So. Okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[46:09]*: Unless you need a Travis, you can just know that it's back there in the background and. But there ought to be audited somehow. You know, somehow there ought to be a way to do it, but we don't have to have it exposed to every user. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[46:20]*: Okay, so maybe just cut that down to three tabs instead of four. And. Okay, so, Travis, go over. Let's flip back again, because I think the screen that you get to when in the. In the current web app that you've got, Travis, looks quite a bit different than that. 
**Travis James** *[46:40]*: Yes, it does. And I'm trying to. I don't need to figure out why it looks different, but I'm about to show you kind of what it looks like. So this is an acquisition I've selected and say I want to edit it. And so there's a few, you know, things here. It looks quite a different. Different from your screen. And I. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[47:19]*: And. 
**Travis James** *[47:19]*: And I, And I can't account for that right now because I. The. The instructions, you know, were to take an exact replica right. Of the thing, and maybe it missed something. But here, you know, basically you have general. You have the financials. 
**Hal Coon** *[47:37]*: Okay, hang on, let me look at these. Let me look at each one of them one at a time. So general is just like. Okay, Okay. And then financials. And if you had multiple fees. Oh, I see. They're being put. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[48:03]*: So it. It looks like this was generated by AI and broken into categories based on the little things that were on the screen that were looking at from this part. Is that what happened here? 
**Travis James** *[48:14]*: Yeah, that's what happened. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[48:16]*: So, like, the invoice information that's down on the bottom right, Invoice number, invoice date, invoice due, invoice paid. That all got put. Well, not all of it, but some of it got the commission. That commission, percent commission number, invoice info get put here. 
**Hal Coon** *[48:36]*: Yeah, and what are they. What are the. The carrots? You know, the Chevron things are going up and down. What are those do. Yeah, well, that one. Yeah, that's a little. I'm talking about the ones that like next commission. 
**Travis James** *[48:50]*: Oh, next to commission. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[48:52]*: I mean, that should just be. That should just be an entry field. 
**Travis James** *[48:55]*: On a. Yeah, that's a. That's an entry field. Yeah. And it's a number. So this. The up and down would go higher. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[49:05]*: What about the dollar. What about the dollar amount that's over there to the commissions? What is it? Does that just let you enter it? 
**Travis James** *[49:11]*: Yeah, you can enter it right here or you can go and do up and down, and it does it by $1 at a time. 
**Hal Coon** *[49:20]*: But how did it come up with that? 
**Travis James** *[49:23]*: Well, this was AI coming to. I can tell you how it came up with it. It Goes and looks at the field. Is it numeric? Is it currency in everything? And then it created this. And, and what I'm saying is that AI didn't do exactly what I told it to do, which was to replicate exactly. But one of the problems with it, I knew why I'm using a totally different library to build this ui. It's a completely different open source library and it made choices. Now we'll have to just. I'm going to have to go back and look at the original again and then figure out what kind of choices we want to make that work. 
**Hal Coon** *[50:05]*: The reason the question was more to. I noticed that Auto Calculate isn't checked, but I notice it has a commission. So how did it calculate that commission if it doesn't know what the commission is? Or does it know because it knows it's a Vanguard deal and it knows what Vanguard's commissions are. 
**Travis James** *[50:22]*: Oh, but then the question has to. 
**Hal Coon** *[50:24]*: Be a field that's not checked. 
**Travis James** *[50:26]*: I'm going to check on this. It's a property on an entity and so that could be. So, so I'm not sure if it's calculated or not. I can look and see or whatever. But this, all these things are results of like you have an entity called Acquisition and it has properties on it that some of them come straight from the database. Some of them might be calculated. I'll look and see. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[50:52]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[50:52]*: But, but it's, it's. That's a different library. So there's another library that handles all the entities that should be an exact replica of the old library. And, and it did a good job of that. I'm pretty sure it did it. Right. So a calculated value then that's. It's using the same one. But we can validate. I can validate that. Okay. Yeah. All right. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[51:15]*: Travis, did you have. When we spoke the other day. And I'm gonna. I've got a hard stop at 11 I want to make and I don't want to end the call, but I'm going to drop off. But the. What about the storage of documents? Did you have a question about. 
**Travis James** *[51:35]*: Yes, questions about that. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[51:37]*: And. And I want to make sure we get as much information from HAL as we can about what you need to know to keep moving forward here. 
**Travis James** *[51:45]*: Yeah, let's talk about the documents. So here we have the documents for this. Now let me look at. Let me. I'm sorry, let me look at my logs here. Make sure that. That something didn't crap like. Meaning that. No, it's all good. Okay, just disarming me. Okay. All right. So I have a store. This is the. I'm to the point where I'm working out all the storage stuff right now. And when I'm just going through the code, there's a couple odd things. I just want to make sure I handle them in a consistent way. Now, this is easier in that I need to up. Upload a document. This works where it'll take the document. Right. But I have to decide where I want to put it. On the. I have a Azure storage file serve Blob storage. And it doesn't understand. 
**Travis James** *[52:52]*: It does understand directories. Now, question is, now if you go back to the general here, you see this folder location? Okay. So this mapped to a directory, I believe, on your hard drive. 
**Hal Coon** *[53:10]*: Actually, in the old application that was literally physical because they were having trouble keeping up with physical pieces of paper. And so when were over at the other building, we had this weird L shaped office space. And because the way were spread out everywhere, people would write in there. It's in Adam's office or it's in the concert. So folder location means something different in the old one, unfortunately. 
**Travis James** *[53:35]*: Oh, that's what was confusing me. 
**Hal Coon** *[53:39]*: Yeah, I could see why, because it was talking about a piece of paper and you're working with zeros and ones, but it meant literally, where is the manila folder. So very confusing. I can see where that would be. Yeah, this should be more like you decide. Like, for example, if you go back to general, you had a number there. Or somewhere in one of these things, there was a thing that was a number and it indicated it was this particular deal. Maybe you had the big list. It was your big list. 
**Travis James** *[54:11]*: Yeah, yeah. That would be the. That's another thing that I would like to kind of change too, is that this thing is not intuitive, like where I expect a web app, like you do a selection and you go. You should be able to go back and then go back to the list and you can't do that. You know what I'm saying? 
**Hal Coon** *[54:28]*: Yeah. No, I mean, you should follow your intuition because you got to remember this was written like this was written a long time ago when a lot of different things were happening in the industry. So there was a reason we picked using the browser, There was a reason we picked the docu share. You know, there was reasons for all that. They're all expired. So we can be as creative as you want to be as long as it meets the needs of these simple screens and the simple output, you know, which is basically an invoice and a notification, an operator notification to a seller and a buyer. So, yeah, I would encourage you that. 
**Hal Coon** *[55:03]*: But what I was going to say was the way, and this is just me thinking out loud, where you have that acquisition id, however that was generated, that can be stub entry point into the cloud storage for when you see that designator, you're storing something for that particular, you know, and just we don't have to know where it is as long as it knows how to drive down to get to it. 
**Travis James** *[55:26]*: Okay, all right, now that makes things easier. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[55:29]*: So you're saying everything, you're saying the acquisition ID is sort of the route, that everything is tied to an acquisition id. Is that right? 
**Hal Coon** *[55:41]*: Yeah, except in the old one, I got the only caveat there is, in the old one, there were two acquisition IDs because there was a, a letter agreement ID and there was an acquisition ID and they didn't, you know, you got a letter agreement ID and it ran along for a while and you associated documents with it, and then when you converted it to an acquisition, it flipped over. And those documents didn't necessarily move over unless they were part of the deal. It was kind of complicated and didn't quite, we never quite perfected it, but that was the idea, was that stub number, everything associated with it got stored with it. That's how DocuShare worked and all that. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[56:19]*: So is there still, in today's world, is there a, in the case where an acquisition gets created and an acquisition ID gets created, that acquisition ID inherits the letter agreements that went, that preceded it, but the opposite is not true, that sometimes letter agreements go nowhere and don't end up in an acquisition id. Correct. Is that, is that right? 
**Hal Coon** *[56:53]*: So that's right. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[56:54]*: But, but the sequence is that a letter agreement ID gets created and those letter agreements have to go somewhere. Those documents have to go somewhere and there isn't an acquisition ID yet. Right, Right. And so you've got letter agreements that might be there that ultimately don't end up with an acquisition ID. And then you've got acquisition IDs that come along and inherit the letter agreement documents that went that go with it. Is that, is that right? So it's almost like. I'm not sure if I'm saying that the right way, but I think, and I think what you're saying is that once an acquisition ID exists, that can be the way to go find everything that's associated with that as Long as the letter agreements that preceded it get tied to it somehow. 
**Hal Coon** *[57:46]*: That's exactly right. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[57:47]*: But. But the letter agreement IDs are also important because sometimes those don't ever get. You need to get back to those letter agreement documents. But the letter agreements don't ever turn out to be an acquisition. Right? Yeah. Does that make sense, Travis? 
**Travis James** *[58:05]*: Yes, it does. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[58:06]*: So I'm not. From a storage standpoint, I haven't figured out how to edit a picture in my head. But those rules are solid. 
**Hal Coon** *[58:20]*: And I can tell you the way Docushare handled it was they created that numeric stub that was like just a UID kind of thing, type thing. Then underneath it, they had very structured things for everything, where they would say PDF files, Excel files, have all these different file types that it kept. If you could get down beneath that guid, you could see them and you could find your files. 
**Travis James** *[58:45]*: But it. 
**Hal Coon** *[58:46]*: Enough behind that GUID that you just were encouraged not to ever get down in that file structure. 
**Travis James** *[58:53]*: Okay, so let's. Okay, that's very helpful because, you know, I already wrote something that manages the files and I gotta adapt it to do what we're, you know, doing here and then put. Put them together. So. 
**Hal Coon** *[59:05]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[59:08]*: So that. That's very helpful. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[59:09]*: Is there, Is there any. So, so what we've centered on there is we centered on the. The acquisition ID and the letter agreement id. Right. Is there, Is there any other thing that files need to be tethered to or, you know, any other kind of files that need to get stored and managed that. That are not associated with a letter agreement or an acquisition id? A letter. Letter id, letter agreement id or an acquisition agreement id? No. 
**Hal Coon** *[59:44]*: Well, I can't think, you know, when. Until you get to invoicing, and then it sort of is associated with those two. As long as you're. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[59:51]*: Yeah. The invoice would go along. The invoice would be tied to the acquisition. Right. Because if there's no acquisition, there's no invoice. 
**Travis James** *[59:58]*: Right? 
**Randy Jesberg** *[59:59]*: Right. 
**Travis James** *[59:59]*: Right. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:00:00]*: Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:00:00]*: Yeah. That's the only other one I can think of that has an association with that number. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:00:04]*: Okay. And. And I know that. That Everett, when he took us through doing letter agreements, that it is the. Is the first time you do a letter agreement, it generates the id. And then if you regenerate for that same seller, does that all. Do those. Those subsequent documents all end up under that same letter id? 
**Hal Coon** *[01:00:28]*: Yeah, because he might go back and forth two or three times with. I don't like the terms there. Change the terms. But it's still that same letter, that. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:00:37]*: Same one, until he creates a new one. If he does a new one, then it's a new one. Right, Right. Okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:00:43]*: But usually they just rework that one until they get it like the guy wants it. And so that implies that it's got version control. 
**Travis James** *[01:00:52]*: Mm. Which we can have. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:01:00]*: Yeah. And I would think you wouldn't need to have it more than, like, two or three versions back, but. Yeah, you know, just enough that you could get, like, oh, I screwed up and saved the wrong one, you know? 
**Travis James** *[01:01:09]*: Yeah. Okay. I'll make sure that happens. Okay. All right. But so far here, though, you. Are you pretty satisfied with, like, look and feel? 
**Hal Coon** *[01:01:22]*: Yeah, yeah. The look and feel is. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:01:23]*: It's all. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:01:24]*: You know, it's actually better than I anticipated because it's so familiar, but with the exception of that one that we're broken into multiple pages, that's. I don't expect you to get it all back to one page unless you can. But because it's. It's a complicated question. 
**Travis James** *[01:01:38]*: Let's take a look. Let's take a look at that, because we can listen to acquisitions. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:01:44]*: Yeah. When you run the acquisitions. Yeah. 
**Travis James** *[01:01:47]*: Here. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:01:47]*: Like. Like, if you went to. If you went to counties and operators. Okay. See, you just. You can see how looking at the screen, you can't really tell what deal you're in. Somehow there has to be something that sort of wraps around this limited bit of information but still tells you generally where you are. 
**Travis James** *[01:02:07]*: How would this work if. If we had a header panel that had all the stuff that set deal contacts that was always visible. Right. And then the tabs like this would just. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:02:18]*: Yeah, that would be. That would be perfect, because then they could see what they're dealing with, but they could go to the object type they wanted to deal with. 
**Travis James** *[01:02:25]*: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So that's. Yeah, that's what I. Yeah, that's good. Okay. And I can. I can get rid of location. Can I get rid of that from the ui, or is that. You still need that? 
**Hal Coon** *[01:02:34]*: No, we don't. 
**Travis James** *[01:02:35]*: We. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:02:36]*: We. We solved the problem. We moved to a different building. 
**Travis James** *[01:02:39]*: Okay. And then Landman. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:02:42]*: Yeah, we still need to know the landman responsible. We don't need the field Landman. We just need the Landman. 
**Travis James** *[01:02:48]*: So you don't need to be able to change it. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:02:50]*: Oh, we do. 
**Travis James** *[01:02:51]*: We. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:02:51]*: Well, we need to assign it, you know? 
**Travis James** *[01:02:53]*: Okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:02:54]*: I don't know how you. When you do that, but it needs to be assignable. 
**Travis James** *[01:02:57]*: Okay, this is assignable. This is. Basically drops down here to the Name and you can choose from kind of thing. Okay. All right, all right, we have the seller name and you can add sellers or whatever. The thing that I didn't, don't see is buyers. And I'm not sure what that missed there where. But yeah, see that, let's say if I made buy, is it okay to make buyers one of these tabs? Right. Add as a tab and then that way you can manage multiple. Yeah, you could have one or. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:03:30]*: Yeah, yeah, as long as, you know, in that one I saw where you pulled up an ad seller. Yeah, well that seller, that makes sense because you're making a deal with the guy, you're adding him and from that you're gonna. Okay, but if, but the buyer, when you add the buyer, it's gonna have a drop down list or something, right? 
**Travis James** *[01:03:50]*: That's right. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:03:51]*: Okay. Yeah, as long as it's like that's fine. 
**Travis James** *[01:03:54]*: Okay. All right, good. I will remember that. Okay. All right, so in the documents we have these document types, right? So there's a document type and then let's see. All right. Okay. Okay, get it. Okay, so I'll work on this. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:04:20]*: And these should be over there on the generate document. Because you generally don't upload acquisition documents, you generally generate the acquisition documents. 
**Travis James** *[01:04:29]*: Oh, okay. I don't need this button and generate document. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:04:32]*: Well, you need them both, but they're for different things. The upload document would be if something came in the mail to support that guy's title, we would scan it and attach it to the record. But if the guy needed a letter stating that his taxes were paid, we would generate that document rather than upload it. 
**Travis James** *[01:04:54]*: All right. All right, I might have to come back to you about the rules of enabling this and stuff, but. Yeah. All right, so I can get that done and. All right, so let's take a look at. Here's the buyers list. Okay, here's a buyer's list. You can, you can search here by name or whatever and add a buyer if you want. Is this, is this look sufficient for like what you would need for buyers? 
**Hal Coon** *[01:05:25]*: Well, let me let, click on one so I can see one. You know, just open one up there. 
**Travis James** *[01:05:29]*: Oh, you know what, this did not make it a clickable thing. So I can do that. Oh, hit edit. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:05:37]*: Edit one. 
**Travis James** *[01:05:38]*: Oh yeah, here we go. Yeah, yeah, it did do that. Okay, So basically this, the map buyer or contacts. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:05:48]*: Okay, yeah, that looks, that's right. Yeah, that looks right. 
**Travis James** *[01:05:51]*: Okay, and then if you Go to say, this guy. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:05:57]*: Oh, yeah, that's a different asset. Just means we're hanging on to it. 
**Travis James** *[01:06:01]*: Okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:06:04]*: Yeah, Wellspring. Wellspring. That's a good one. Look at that one. 
**Travis James** *[01:06:08]*: Okay, Contacts. Is it missing? 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:06:13]*: They would. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:06:13]*: Yeah, we could add contacts. Yeah, that's okay. 
**Travis James** *[01:06:16]*: I'm gonna have to look and make sure that they. That the query, you know, actually went. Get. Get those. But. All right, all right. Okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:06:26]*: And how do you set that default commission? I see it's. I see a line there, but I don't see anything in it. 
**Travis James** *[01:06:36]*: Oh, it's a text box. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:06:38]*: Okay, so you're just typing like 20% or. Yeah. Okay. 
**Travis James** *[01:06:42]*: I won't, I won't say. But even though it's not going to anybody's database, but it's not going. It's going. This is all, this is all hooked up to database that's in Azure right now, which is. Has a snapshot, the last one that I got from you guys. So. But I'm not going to change anything because it's like messing up. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:06:56]*: But. 
**Travis James** *[01:06:57]*: Yeah, all right. Okay. And say that works. Okay. And I'll clean up, like, look and feel and stuff so it looks a little bit better or whatever. But. Yeah. Okay, so. But in general, this thing. In general, this thing looks okay, right? Yeah, Counties and here are. And then you can edit county and contacts, appraisal groups. Oh, look, I got an error there. Okay, I'll fix those queries, whatever. But in general, though, is this correct? Okay, Operators. And here you can, you know, select. You can select these guys, edit. And then you can also do in there or go back to the list export. Well, this is something I've got. I've got to work on it, associate with some of the stuff I gotta get, you know, to generate the Excel file. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:08:28]*: And then, you know, this. We don't need that. 
**Travis James** *[01:08:30]*: We do not need this one. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:08:31]*: No, that one went away. 
**Travis James** *[01:08:33]*: Okay, good, good. Awesome, awesome. Let's take a look at prevo groups. Oh, shoot. It's here. It's just. Hold on, give me one second and I can bring up that view. It's. It's. The path is incorrect here too. You know, I thought I had fixed that. Okay. Anyway. Okay, so. Okay, appraisal groups. And so you can add one. And these are path issues. I'm gonna have to dig. I'll dig into. There's a view there, but it's like, it's not. Okay, there we go. Edit a Facebook group. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:09:28]*: Okay, all right. 
**Travis James** *[01:09:30]*: And you can that look in general. Okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:09:35]*: Yes. But when you're calling an appraisal group, is that effectively the county? 
**Travis James** *[01:09:40]*: I don't know what an appraisal group is. Yeah, I think. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:09:43]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[01:09:44]*: Yeah, yeah, it's in your app. It's like a distinct thing. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:09:49]*: And can I see the next set of rows, just so I get a sense of. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's just the counties, but, yeah, that's, you know, their appraisal. They're, you know, like. Okay, see, this is what I was expecting, all this Christian Abbott stuff. I wasn't expecting counties to be in there, so. 
**Travis James** *[01:10:06]*: Well, there's a records in database. There's a record, you know, database. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:10:10]*: Yeah. But, yeah, there's a lot in that database that isn't right. And it doesn't surprise me when I'm seeing this and going, where'd you get that? Oh, in the database. Yeah, well, that just means they're wrong. And it's like. Okay, well, didn't see that one either. But yeah, we're picking up a lot with this. 
**Travis James** *[01:10:25]*: Yeah. Okay. All right. All right, so. And let's take a look at. We looked at letter drinks. Refers here are refers. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:10:40]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[01:10:41]*: Okay. Same type of thing. You can go this. We can edit a refer. Refer. Adam. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:10:49]*: Yep. 
**Travis James** *[01:10:50]*: Upload form. What does that mean? 
**Hal Coon** *[01:10:52]*: That's like their 1099. You know, if they. If we're paying them, then we need to have a 1099 on file. 
**Travis James** *[01:10:58]*: Oh, okay. So, yeah, form type. Yeah, 1099 year. Okay, got it. Okay. All right. Okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:11:11]*: Now let's go to. 
**Travis James** *[01:11:14]*: Reports. So we have a. The reports, they all seem to navigate to this thing, which then has these reports. Now, reports is not going to be quite there yet because I have another report engine thing that's not completely there because this is one of those that had that old library generate report. I've got to fix this. I use a library FAST report, and I got to dig into that part. In general, though, is this correct? Like, you want to do output Excel or to a viewer? Yeah, the. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:12:00]*: I think Excel or our Viewer PDF is fine. I don't know if we need those other. What were the other forms? 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:12:06]*: Yeah. 
**Travis James** *[01:12:08]*: Viewer PDF. Word Raw. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:12:12]*: Yeah, Raw. 
**Travis James** *[01:12:13]*: No. Okay. Gotta get rid of that. Raw. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:12:15]*: Yeah. I don't know why you would do it to Word. What would that mean? 
**Travis James** *[01:12:21]*: It means that somebody, they have a version that will generate a Word document. And, you know, FRAS report does have, like, these generators there for these, but I have to, you know, have to dig into that, you know, a little bit. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:12:33]*: I think all we're trying to do is either get it to a screen or get it to a piece of paper. And that's all you need to worry about. If either displayed on the screen where it's where you can still. And you know, when they're looking at it on the screen, one of the things they don't like about the current one, when we're looking at it on the screen, is it's just like looking at a piece of paper, but it's electronic and they would like it. If you're looking at the report and you see one, you go, what is that? If you could click it and get to the record. I don't know if that's possible, but it's, it just in the other one, it just wasn't even a possibility because the way it was structured. 
**Travis James** *[01:13:04]*: But yeah, I, I, okay, I got it. So, and that's being recorded. So I, I'll get that. I'll make sure that works. Let's see. Documents. Here's it. Okay, here's the big thing. Templates. Okay, so now this isn't going to work because I don't have them in the database yet. I've got to pull the templates files from the location that is pointed to in the old app and I put them in the storage area for this one. Then I will have a way that maps to this. That's what I'm going to be working on this weekend. Map it to the, you know, to the URL. So then, you know. Okay, yeah, so these things, this is like. Because we're at the end when it comes to that stuff is, you know, and then when you say generate cover sheet. 
**Travis James** *[01:14:05]*: So I, I, we don't need that. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:14:08]*: We don't. That was that other thing that, Remember before when there was a red thing and I said, oh, we don't do that anymore. This is, yes, this is part of that same thing. We don't need that anymore either. 
**Travis James** *[01:14:18]*: Right. Because the way it's implemented in your current app is that it's a file sitting there on the hard disk, not even the hard drive, and it included in the build. And I would have had to find a way to get that done. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:14:33]*: Good. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:14:33]*: Yeah, you don't need that. 
**Travis James** *[01:14:34]*: Okay, good. I can just forget that. And then the document search. Okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:14:43]*: Basically what that was you could put any freeform text in there and it would search all the documents and find all the documents that had that. It was Just a feature that Docashir had. And then we got Solaire on the new one. It did it, too. 
**Travis James** *[01:14:59]*: All right, so I'll make this. This is going to be easier for me because I know. I'll just do full text search on the thing and make sure. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:15:10]*: Yeah. Show acquisition details is. So when it did pull up a list of documents, it would show you which acquisitions had that document. 
**Travis James** *[01:15:19]*: Okay, got it. Okay, I got it. All right. See. See if I can get it to match something. You know, I don't. I haven't certified this yet, so we'll see. I'll work on that. Okay. All right. But that's very helpful, though. So now that's going to go fast. Okay. When you say view form, what is that supposed to mean? 
**Hal Coon** *[01:15:49]*: You know when you're looking at the screen for an acquisition and. 
**Travis James** *[01:15:53]*: Yes. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:15:53]*: And it's showing you all those. It's showing you one acquisition. That would be what we would call a form. And then list is that other set. You show me where it's got all the rows and columns. That's. And form is the screen. That just shows you a deal. 
**Travis James** *[01:16:12]*: Do I need this? 
**Hal Coon** *[01:16:17]*: Well, think about it. If you're right here, right now, where are we? So you're somewhere and you've got to get back, and you either want to go back to the list, you're going to want to go back to the view. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:16:28]*: That. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:16:28]*: That's what I mean. 
**Travis James** *[01:16:29]*: The form. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:16:29]*: That's why it's there. It's so from a screen like this, you can get back to something. 
**Travis James** *[01:16:37]*: Okay, so this is the thing that was odd. Hard for me to understand about the app a little bit was because. See all these. You know, let's see. That's the reason why you don't do minis, man. Yeah. Because you don't know the context. Right. I go into another screen. I agree. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:16:55]*: I agree. It's. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:16:56]*: It's. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:16:57]*: But as long as you understand what it was for and you make it so that visually it's easy to get between the list and the form, then we don't need that. But again, there's so much old history in the way things used to work, is why this works the way it does, that it's okay for you to break the old form and do it the modern way, that's fine. But that's all we're trying to do is get between the two views of the list and the. The deal, you know, however you want to think about it. 
**Travis James** *[01:17:28]*: All right, I'll think about how I Make this apply. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:17:30]*: Now, as far as apply filter and apply that's where you would. Oh, wait a minute, let me think about that for a second. That may have been where we built our views. You went into that. Wait, go to that and then you go. No, Apply builder, Apply view. No, it was under Tools. 
**Travis James** *[01:17:44]*: There's Tools. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:17:45]*: Does it have views under there? Yeah, yeah. That's where they got built. Was there? 
**Travis James** *[01:17:48]*: Yeah, that's right. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:17:50]*: Yeah. So that view is. Yeah, I don't think you. 
**Travis James** *[01:17:52]*: Yeah, yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:17:55]*: Being able to build them and stable. Yeah. 
**Travis James** *[01:17:57]*: Okay. And then the rest of this is administration stuff. So like lean types, you can administer that. Curative types, deal statuses, Letter agreement, deal statuses, folder locations, which. Which we don't need anymore. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:18:24]*: Right, right. 
**Travis James** *[01:18:24]*: Okay. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:18:27]*: New. 
**Travis James** *[01:18:28]*: And then here you can create a new user. It'll create a new user for you. Right. And then edit user. I've seen edits that current user's information. Is that right? 
**Hal Coon** *[01:18:39]*: I would. Yeah, I guess so. I haven't done this in a while. 
**Travis James** *[01:18:42]*: I'm probably going to change that probably. Because that's not exactly intuitive. Like, I'm probably going to do this. Like, you see, this was this thing where you can go to dark mode, have light dark mode. I'm gonna print when you logged in. There's gonna be an icon next to this which is like the user have your. Your initials. You click on that and then it'll take you to the edit user stuff. Because the user info thing object that is probably better accessed if you were to click it there and say profile. Right. And then it'll take you to that. That you can edit your own information. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:19:20]*: The other thing, is it possible to make it where if somebody's a user and they create objects in the database, but then they no longer are. The reason we have all these active users that are just disabled is because if you. If you eliminate them, then their records kind of disappeared. They kind of got perma locked because they didn't. They weren't owned by anybody. 
**Travis James** *[01:19:40]*: Oh yeah, I got you. I got you what you're saying. All right, so, and so here's what. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:19:46]*: He was working on in the inversion 2, the version we never implemented. The way he got around that was he. He put a proxy between everything that got stored and the user, so that he was recording what user did it, but he was actually saving it through this proxy access that represented everybody. You know, everything kind of went through this central thing and it was the owner, but that was the guy that asked the owner to Create it or store it or modify it. That was Peter's solution for that. You can come up with your own. But I mean, I know it's an issue for databases that persist beyond users. 
**Travis James** *[01:20:23]*: Yeah, yeah. I'm going to look at the data and I'll send you a specific proposal for that one. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:20:30]*: Okay. Yeah, yeah. 
**Travis James** *[01:20:36]*: And then you got roles. There's no roles in the database. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:20:38]*: Yeah, I don't think we ever implemented much of that. 
**Travis James** *[01:20:42]*: Can I get rid of that? Because there's no roles and there's no permissions. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:20:45]*: Well, I mean, this is where we probably should have a discussion about deleting data, because it would be a good idea to have admin role and then user role and manager role and all those kind of typical things that you have. 
**Travis James** *[01:21:00]*: If you do want, you have a. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:21:02]*: Bagged version of that stuff. 
**Travis James** *[01:21:04]*: I have a way I can. Okay. I'll just. I'll keep it and I will implement something. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:21:08]*: Okay, Right. 
**Travis James** *[01:21:09]*: And then you can decide what the. What, what that means later. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:21:12]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[01:21:13]*: Okay. All right. And that's. Does all the views in the old application are here. They may. I need to, you know, based on our conversation today, clean them up, make sure that they are linked. Right. Based on what we say. What's text role search? What does that do? 
**Hal Coon** *[01:21:39]*: That was actually a simple search utility to point at the. There's a table out there called mineral roll 2025. 
**Travis James** *[01:21:52]*: Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:21:53]*: Thing that Chris looks at to get his names and addresses. So what that does is that lets these users peer into that and, you know, just find data in that. They can look up a guy or. Or say, let's say a guy sends in a deal, says, I want to sell you this one thing. They can go in there and say, show me everything this guy has and it'll. It'll do that for him. 
**Travis James** *[01:22:13]*: Okay. All right, now that's good. All right. Is there anything that concerns you or anything? Everything. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:22:19]*: Now, the main concern is getting it to where that one screen. Well, this one. Getting it to where you can control it, but you've got for that and then that other one so that it kind of visually makes sense of where you are. But you mentioned the header, so that should work there. 
**Travis James** *[01:22:36]*: Yeah, yeah, I'm going to put that in and I'll put that in right away so you can see what that looks like. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:22:40]*: Okay. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:22:41]*: All right. 
**Travis James** *[01:22:42]*: Other than that, I mean, replicated the whole thing. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:22:45]*: Yeah, no, it looks. Looking good, you know, Anxious to see it. 
**Travis James** *[01:22:49]*: Yes. It's faster than the other one first for sure. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:22:52]*: Yeah, no kidding. 
**Travis James** *[01:22:53]*: Yeah. And. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:22:55]*: And that's records in there of the other one. You mentioned you did an Azure backup. I mean, it's got the records. 
**Travis James** *[01:23:00]*: Yes. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:23:01]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[01:23:02]*: It's got everything to that day. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:23:04]*: Okay, sweet. 
**Travis James** *[01:23:05]*: That did the backup. So. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:23:06]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[01:23:06]*: So. Yeah, yeah, all the records are in there. It's like nothing missing, so. All right. So I think. So I. Now I understand better. Thank you very much for all that stuff. But, you know, we're almost there. I mean, just add the multiple buyers thing, which is how we're going to do that on that panel. Right. And which was the. That was a major, big feature. Can you think of any other features that you were wanting? Feature change right there. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:23:32]*: Well, the. The thing, you know, obviously the letter, you know, the output of the letters is pretty critical, you know, making sure it does the letter agreement correctly, the invoice correctly, and all that. But I assume that's. We'll see once we're at that letter. 
**Travis James** *[01:23:43]*: Yeah, yeah. That's. That's this weekend's work to get into funneling, where we get into that. And. And so that's what we'll be spending all the weekend on. And then that, you know, then we'll have. Then, you know, we'll have a complete thing. Right. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:23:56]*: Yeah. 
**Travis James** *[01:23:56]*: You know, and then we'll just need to test it with you guys to make sure you guys like it and. And all that. And. And then now we have the basis for, like, a bunch of other stuff. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:24:06]*: Okay, cool. 
**Travis James** *[01:24:08]*: Yeah. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:24:08]*: Looks good. 
**Travis James** *[01:24:10]*: Great. Great. Well, I'm glad to like that part and everything. I will let you know when I have addressed all those others. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:24:17]*: Okay. 
**Travis James** *[01:24:18]*: All right. And they send you screenshots of those things, and I'll send you the notes from this so you can see what's going to happen. And, you know, we're. We're. We're right there at the end. Excellent. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:24:27]*: Good to hear. All right, Travis, I appreciate it, man. Well, have a good weekend. 
**Travis James** *[01:24:31]*: Thank you. You too. 
**Hal Coon** *[01:24:32]*: Stay warm. 
**Travis James** *[01:24:33]*: You too. Bye. 
**Randy Jesberg** *[01:24:34]*: Bye. Bye.
